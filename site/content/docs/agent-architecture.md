# Agent Sandbox Architecture

This document defines how an **agent** — an unmodified harness such as
`cmd/chaos-agent`, a LangChain script, or Claude Code — is connected to the
Sovereign Agent Mesh when it runs inside a sandbox (a Firecracker microVM or a
`--network none` container).

It is a design document: it states the layering, the contracts each layer
exposes, and the tests that hold those contracts in place.

What the result costs is measured in
[Scale: what an agent costs]({{< relref "/docs/scale-report" >}}).

## 1. Goals

1. **The harness is unmodified and mesh-unaware.** It opens ordinary sockets, it
   resolves ordinary names, it speaks ordinary HTTP. No SDK, no `LD_PRELOAD`, no
   proxy environment variables it has to honour.
2. **One enforcement point.** Every packet the sandbox emits is authorized in
   exactly one place, by name, against one policy.
3. **The sandbox has no network.** Not a filtered network — *no* network device
   other than the one we hand it. Isolation is a property of the runtime
   (`network=none`, a microVM without a tap device), not of a firewall rule.
4. **The mesh looks like the internet.** Reaching a remote model or a remote MCP
   server is the same act as reaching `api.github.com`: connect to a name. Which
   names are mesh-internal and which are public is a policy decision made on the
   host, not a code path in the agent.
5. **Deps stay put.** The design below adds no `go.mod` entry (see §7).

## 2. Why one enforcement point

There are three common ways to intercept a sandbox's traffic at the application
layer. Each of them leaks, and that is why none of them is used here.

* **Proxy environment variables** are honoured only by HTTP-aware clients. A
  harness that opens a raw socket, a Python library using `httpx` with
  `trust_env=False`, or anything speaking gRPC or Postgres simply escapes.
* **DNS spoofing** forces every flow through a MITM even when no secret needs
  injecting, and it answers with loopback addresses, which destroys the
  destination name the policy engine exists to reason about.
* **An `LD_PRELOAD` socket shim** must be built and served for every arch/libc
  pair, and a statically linked binary defeats it outright.

The shared failure is that each one asks the agent to cooperate with its own
confinement. An agent that has to *agree* to be confined is not confined: the
next library that ignores the convention, the next subprocess that clears its
environment, and the next protocol that is not HTTP are each outside the
boundary.

Routing does not have that failure mode, because nothing has to agree to it. So
the boundary is a route and a socket rather than a convention, and there is
exactly one of them — one place where a flow is named, decided and opened.

## 3. The layering

One socket, one protocol, one policy point. Named HTTP tunnels are the waist.

### Decision 1 — named HTTP tunnels are the sandbox boundary protocol

The boundary speaks authority-form `CONNECT` (RFC 9110) for TCP and
connect-udp (RFC 9298, capsules per RFC 9297) for UDP. An earlier revision of
this document chose SOCKS5 over HTTP proxying, for three properties; the
reversal is worth being explicit about, because all three properties are kept
and the reasons the comparison once favoured SOCKS5 stopped being true:

* **It carries the destination name.** `CONNECT api.github.com:443` is
  authority-form: the gateway authorizes `api.github.com`, not
  `140.82.121.5`. Domain filtering still needs no DNS interception, no MITM
  and no IP allowlists that rot. connect-udp carries the name the same way,
  in the URI template `/.well-known/masque/udp/{host}/{port}/`.
* **It is protocol-agnostic.** After the `200 OK` the tunnel is a byte pipe.
  `git`, Postgres, gRPC and a raw socket are all first-class; HTTP is the
  *handshake*, not a requirement on the payload.
* **It has a refusal vocabulary.** A policy denial is `403` with a
  `Boundary-Reason` header, which tun2connect turns into a clean
  `ECONNREFUSED` in the guest — exactly what an agent should observe when it
  reaches for something it may not have — while an operator reading a log
  sees the reason in words.

What SOCKS5 could not offer, and what decided the reversal:

* **One protocol in both directions.** The reverse channel into a sandbox
  (§9.2) always spoke `CONNECT <port>`; now egress and ingress are the same
  shape, and there is one grammar to reason about on the whole boundary.
* **Headers are the extension point.** Sandbox identity for multiplexing
  rides in `Proxy-Authorization` (§8.5), and anything else — tracing, a
  sandbox id — is a header away. SOCKS5 had a fixed binary vocabulary and
  nowhere to put any of that.
* **UDP fits.** `UDP ASSOCIATE` presumes a datagram socket beside the TCP
  one, which never fit a boundary that is a single Unix socket. connect-udp
  frames datagrams as capsules *on the same stream*, so UDP arrives named,
  policy-checked and audit-delimited like every TCP flow (§11).
* **It is curl-testable.** `curl --proxy` speaks the TCP half natively, which
  makes the boundary probeable with a tool every operator already has.

HTTP MITM does not disappear; it moves *above* the waist. When a domain is
configured for secret injection, the gateway terminates TLS for that flow with
the existing `internal/sambox` ephemeral CA and injects the header. Every other
flow is a byte pipe with no interception at all — a meaningful improvement over
the status quo, where every flow is MITM'd.

### Decision 2 — names are resolved on the host, never in the guest

tun2connect answers guest DNS from synthetic pools it invents — IPv4 out of
`100.64.0.0/10` (CGNAT space: link-local would be leak-proof, but SSRF guards
in HTTP clients commonly block `169.254/16` and would break legitimate
egress), IPv6 out of `100::/64` (the RFC 6666 discard prefix, so an escaped
packet blackholes). The guest resolver gets a synthetic address, the engine
maps it back to the FQDN when the flow opens, and the gateway receives the
FQDN in the tunnel request. A flow whose destination was never resolved has
no name and is refused in the guest. Nothing in the guest ever performs a
real DNS lookup, so:

* `nano-init`'s DNS spoofer, `/etc/resolv.conf` rewrite, `HTTP_PROXY` injection
  and `libinterceptor.so` bootstrap are **deleted**, not reimplemented;
* the guest cannot exfiltrate over DNS, because there is no resolver path out;
* the policy engine gets the name for free, on every flow, for every protocol.

### Decision 3 — the host never speaks AF_VSOCK

Firecracker's vsock device already terminates AF_VSOCK and hands the host a Unix
socket per guest port (`<uds_path>_<port>`). The gateway therefore accepts on a
`net.Listener` that is *always* a UDS. A microVM and a `network=none` container
become the same code path, and the difference is one line of sandbox setup:

| sandbox | guest side | host side |
|---|---|---|
| Firecracker microVM | `tun2connect` → vsock CID 2, port *P* | listener on `<uds>_P` |
| container, `network=none` | `tun2connect` → `/run/sam/agent.sock` | listener on the bind-mounted path |

This keeps AF_VSOCK out of the Go code entirely (no new dependency) and — more
importantly for the test pyramid — makes the whole datapath exercisable in a Go
integration test against a UDS in `t.TempDir()`, with no VM and no KVM.

### Decision 4 — a mesh name is the service namespace written in DNS shape

The mesh already has a canonical namespace: `mcp://<service>`,
`inference://<service>`, `system://sam.catalog`, and internally
`libp2p://<peer>/<type>/<service>/…`. That namespace is what the control plane
authorizes in `allowed_services` and what lands in the Biscuit `service()` fact.
Sandbox names are a **projection of it**, not a second namespace:

```text
inference://openrouter   <->   openrouter.inference.sam.alt
mcp://code-reviewer      <->   code-reviewer.mcp.sam.alt
(the mesh, curated)      <->   mesh.sam.alt
```

The mapping is declared once, in [`api/names.go`](https://github.com/google/sam/blob/main/api/names.go)
(`MeshZone`, `MeshEntrypointHost`, `MeshHost`, `ParseMeshHost`), so the gateway
and the node cannot drift. The rule that keeps it honest: **never introduce a
routing decision expressible in one form but not the other.**

`.alt` is the pseudo-TLD reserved by RFC 9476 for namespaces that are
deliberately *not* resolved through the DNS — which is exactly what these are.
It cannot collide with a delegated gTLD, and a name that escapes a sandbox fails
closed instead of resolving to somebody else's host. `.local` was rejected: it
is mDNS's (RFC 6762) and resolvers treat it specially.

Provider selection is *not* in the name. `openrouter.inference.sam.alt` says
which service, never which peer; that stays a discovery decision, scored by the
existing provider scorer. Pinning a peer would mirror `libp2p://<peer>/…` as a
longer name, but needs a DNS-safe peer encoding first — base58 peer IDs are
case-sensitive and DNS labels are not. IPFS hit the same wall and solved it with
lowercase base36 CIDs in subdomain gateways; that is the path if we ever need
it, and it is noted in `api/names.go` rather than half-built.

### Decision 5 — the agent is the principal; the node is only the channel

Traceability and granular policy are the product. "Agent `foo` may use
`inference://X`, agent `bar` may not" has to be a statement the *whole mesh* can
evaluate, and it has to survive an agent being paused on one node and resumed on
another. So agent identity travels with the agent, never with the host.

A Biscuit is bound to a peer ID: `SamNode.Authorize` requires a `node(<peer>)`
fact matching the connecting peer and enforces `BaselineReplayCheck`
(`client_peer_id == connection_peer_id`). That binding is right — for the
*channel*. It is the wrong place to express *who is asking*.

The mesh already knows how to take in a foreign identity, and agents reuse that
pattern one level down. A node presents an OIDC JWT **once**, at enrollment; the
control plane verifies it against a configured issuer and mints a Biscuit;
`translateClaimsToFacts` turns claims into facts, and the JWT never appears on
the datapath again. The two domains are joined at exactly one point and never
mixed:

| | asserted by | verified against | when | on the datapath as |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| node identity | control plane | the OIDC issuer | enrollment | a Biscuit |
| agent identity | the enrolled SAM component that admitted the agent | the platform's workload issuer (K8s SA token, pod certificate, SVID) | admission | an appended Biscuit block |

The agent's facts ride as an **attenuation block appended to the node token**,
not as a second credential. `biscuit-go` cannot verify a block signed by a third
party (§8.2), so splitting them buys no extra cryptographic attribution while
costing a second verification on every request. The identifier is still the
agent's and still portable: teleport the actor to another worker and the SAM
component there verifies the same workload credential and asserts the same
`agent:` name. Nothing downstream notices the move.

The residual trust, stated plainly: an enrolled node asserts its own agents.
Mesh policy limits this with a role's `allowed_agents`, which lists the
namespaces a node is allowed to use. Only a node whose role grants `*.c1.acme`
can claim an agent in that namespace, and a node with no grant cannot name any
agent at all. Non-repudiation *by the agent itself* needs proof of possession,
which stays an upgrade path (§8.6).

## 4. Where the gateway lives: `sam-box`, without a libp2p host

There are two binaries with disjoint jobs.

**`sam-node` — the mesh member.** It owns the libp2p host, enrollment, identity,
discovery and the sidecar API (`/mcp`, `/v1/*`, `/sam/service/*`,
`/sam/<peer>/…`) over TCP and its Unix socket.

**`sam-box` — the sandbox dataplane.** One per sandbox. It holds **no libp2p
host, no enrollment, no mesh identity**. It serves the named-tunnel boundary
(CONNECT, connect-udp) on the sandbox-facing socket, enforces the egress
policy, does MITM/secret injection where configured, and reaches the mesh
solely by dialling the local `sam-node` sidecar Unix socket as a client.

What this buys:

* *N* sandboxes per host still share **one** libp2p host, so no *N*× DHT
  clients, identify/ping loops or router connections — the thing that would
  otherwise cap density in the scale experiment.
* `sam-box` becomes small and boring: an HTTP CONNECT server plus an HTTP
  client. No `join`, no OIDC, no Biscuit handling, no bbolt store. Most of
  [cmd/sam-box/main.go](cmd/sam-box/main.go) is deleted.
* The blast radius of a compromised sandbox stops at its `sam-box`, which holds
  one agent credential and can be killed and reissued in isolation.
* Failure isolation and lifecycle match the sandbox's, not the host's.

`sam-box` is a **multiplexer of agents**: it may serve one agent per socket, or
many agents over one socket, and each flow it forwards carries that agent's own
identity (Decision 5, §8). Losing the libp2p host costs it nothing here — the
agent's authority never came from the host in the first place.

`internal/sambox` keeps the ephemeral CA and secret injection and gains the
CONNECT server; `internal/node` keeps everything mesh.

## 5. Contracts

### 5.1 What the harness sees

```bash
OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://mesh.sam.alt/v1   # inference, provider chosen by policy
MCP_URL=http://mesh.sam.alt/mcp          # tools: local catalog + remote services
```

No `HTTP_PROXY`. No CA bundle, unless a domain is explicitly configured for
secret injection. No mesh concepts, and no token of any kind.
`cmd/chaos-agent` already takes `--mcp-url` and `--inference-url`, so it needs
no change beyond the values it is given.

A harness that wants one specific service instead of policy-chosen routing uses
its mesh name directly: `http://code-reviewer.mcp.sam.alt/`.

### 5.2 Gateway dispatch

Applied to the tunnel request's `(host, port)` — `host` is the name
`tun2connect` preserved, never an IP — in order:

1. **`mesh.sam.alt`** (`api.IsMeshEntrypointHost`) → the gateway's own
   agent-facing surface, served in process: `/v1/models`,
   `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/completions`, and `/mcp`. Nothing else. Any
   other path is refused with 403 and never reaches the node.

   **The agent never touches the node.** A `sam-node` sidecar is a local,
   operator-facing API: it can register services under the node's identity, and
   its `/sam/<peer>/<type>/<name>` proxy will carry a request to any peer and
   service the caller names. Worse, arriving on its Unix socket *is* the
   credential — `withAuth` treats reaching the socket as proof of authorization,
   on the grounds that it is the same bar as reading the token file. So piping
   an agent's bytes to that socket would hand every sandbox the node's full
   local authority. `sam-box` is the node's consumer; the agent is the mesh's
   consumer, through `sam-box`, and the two are different surfaces.

   Discovery is deliberately absent from the list even though agents need it:
   MCP already exposes `find_remote_tools` and `discover_remote_services` as
   tools, so opening `/sam/service/discover` as well would widen the surface
   without adding a capability.
2. **`<service>.<type>.sam.alt`** (`api.ParseMeshHost`) → `sam-box` terminates
   HTTP and rewrites onto the sidecar's existing surface:
   `GET /sam/service/discover?type=<type>&name=<service>` picks a provider, then
   the request is reverse-proxied to `/sam/<peer>/<type>/<service>/<path>`. No
   new sidecar endpoint, no libp2p in `sam-box`.
3. **anything else** → egress policy (§5.3). Allowed flows are dialled directly;
   flows on a secret-injection domain are terminated with the ephemeral CA.
4. **no match, or a name in the zone that resolves to nothing** → `403` with
   `Boundary-Reason: not allowed by policy`.

Case 2 is the only one that inspects payload, and only because provider
selection is an HTTP-level decision. `https://` to a mesh name therefore needs
the ephemeral CA trusted in the guest; v1 documents mesh names as `http://`
(the transport underneath is libp2p, already authenticated and encrypted) and
leaves guest CA installation to sandbox image build rather than a bootstrap
endpoint.

### 5.3 Egress policy

Deny-by-default, evaluated on the name, expressed in the node config next to the
existing `attenuation` block:

```yaml
version: v1
sandbox:
  egress:
    allow:
      - "api.github.com"
      - "*.pypi.org"
    secrets:
      "api.github.com":
        kind: bearer
        value_from: /etc/sam/secrets/github
```

Filtering by name without MITM is honest here: the gateway dials the name it
authorized and, for TLS, requires the client's SNI to match it.

### 5.4 What a sandbox must provide

`nano-init` builds the route out of a sandbox. It does not build the sandbox,
so a profile is the answer to "who provides the isolation", and there are three
supported answers. Each must satisfy the same five preconditions:

1. **A network namespace with no way out.** No interface but loopback. This is
   the one that cannot be compromised: an agent with a second route does not
   have a boundary, it has a suggestion.
2. **A private `/etc/resolv.conf`.** `nano-init` points it at the resolver on
   `tun0`, so anything sharing that file would have its DNS repointed too.
3. **A Unix socket to the boundary.** Sockets are filesystem objects and are
   unaffected by the network namespace, which is what lets the sandbox have no
   network and still be reachable.
4. **A way to create a TUN device.** A kernel with `CONFIG_TUN` in a microVM;
   `/dev/net/tun` plus `CAP_NET_ADMIN` elsewhere.
5. **PID 1**, so children are reaped and signals and exit codes travel.

| | `docker run --network none` | Firecracker microVM | Kubernetes pod |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| netns with no way out | the container runtime | the guest kernel, given no network device | **nothing does** |
| private `resolv.conf` | the container's mount namespace | the guest rootfs | **nothing does** |
| boundary socket | bind-mounted UDS | vsock, surfacing on the host as `<uds>_<port>` | shared `emptyDir` |
| TUN | `--device /dev/net/tun --cap-add NET_ADMIN` | `CONFIG_TUN` in the guest kernel | `hostPath` of type `CharDevice` |
| PID 1 | the container's entrypoint | `/sbin/init` | the container's entrypoint |
| isolation strength | namespaces, shared kernel | own kernel | namespaces, shared kernel |

The first two columns are satisfied by the runtime. The third is not, and the
reason is structural rather than an oversight: **every container in a pod shares
one network namespace**, so there is no per-container equivalent of
`--network none`, and the `resolv.conf` the kubelet generates is shared by all
of them. A pod profile therefore has to create those two namespaces for itself,
inside the container, before `nano-init` starts.

The pod column needs no capabilities, which is worth stating because the obvious
guesses are both wrong. The device cgroup does not deny `/dev/net/tun`, so no
device plugin is involved and a bind mount is enough; and granting
`CAP_SYS_ADMIN` alone is actively worse than granting nothing, because the
namespace then gets created without the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` the tun needs. Creating
a user namespace first supplies both over the namespaces it owns, so that is the
path taken whenever user namespaces are available. What a pod does need is a
seccomp and AppArmor policy that permits `unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER|CLONE_NEWNS)`
and `mount` — Kubernetes applies neither profile by default, and Docker's
defaults block both.

Because the failure is silent -- `tun0` alongside `eth0` is a working network,
not an error -- `nano-init` refuses to start in a namespace that has any
interface other than loopback and its own tun, whichever profile is in use.
That check is what makes a third profile safe to add rather than a way to
quietly lose the boundary.

## 6. Test plan

Coverage is pushed as far down the pyramid as it will go. Firecracker appears
exactly once, at the top.

**Unit (`internal/…`, `api/`).** CONNECT and connect-udp request parsing, the
refusal-status mapping and the RFC 9297 capsule codec; the name↔URI
projection (`api/names_test.go`, already landed); dispatch classification
(`mesh.sam.alt` / mesh name / public / denied); the agent-facing path allowlist;
wildcard matching in the egress allowlist; SNI-vs-authorized-name mismatch.
Pure functions, microseconds.

**Integration (`tests/integration/`, budget 10s each).** The whole datapath, no
containers:

* node A registers a fake OpenAI-compatible backend — reuse the
  `registerInferenceService` + `httptest` pattern already in
  `openai_facade_test.go`;
* node B registers a fake MCP service — reuse `newFakeMCPHandler`;
* node C runs with a sidecar Unix socket, and a `sam-box` beside it serves
  the boundary on a second socket in `t.TempDir()`;
* the test opens real CONNECT tunnels over that socket (stdlib `net/http`, the
  same wire shape tun2connect produces) and asserts:
  1. `mesh.sam.alt:80` → `/v1/chat/completions` reaches A's fake LLM across the mesh,
  2. `mesh.sam.alt:80` → `/mcp` `call_remote_tool` reaches B's fake MCP,
  3. `<svc>.mcp.sam.alt:80` resolves through discovery to B and reaches it,
  4. an allowlisted public name reaches a local `httptest` server,
  5. a non-allowlisted name is refused with `403`,
  6. no path outside `/v1/*` and `/mcp` reaches node C at all.

**E2E (`tests/e2e/*.bats`).** Two CUJs, no more:

* *Container sandbox*: `docker run --network none` with the real harness plus
  `nano-init`, a bind-mounted UDS to a host `sam-node`, against the existing bats
  mesh (`lib/container_mesh.bash`). Asserts a real inference call, a real tool
  call, and one blocked domain.
* *microVM sandbox*: the same rootfs under Firecracker, `skip` unless `/dev/kvm`
  is present. It exists to prove the vsock↔UDS mapping and nothing else; every
  behavioural assertion is already covered above.

## 7. Dependencies

Nothing on the host requires a `go.mod` change:

* CONNECT / connect-udp **server** — a few hundred lines against the stdlib,
  including the RFC 9297 capsule codec, on a Unix socket.
* CONNECT **client** (tests, `sam-bench`) — stdlib `net/http` request writing.
* AF_VSOCK — never touched by Go code (Decision 3).
* MITM CA and secret injection — `internal/sambox`, already ours.
* Mesh name projection — `api/names.go`, stdlib only.

### 7.1 The guest-side datapath: tun2connect

The guest side is Go, in `cmd/nano-init`, which is **its own module**
(`github.com/google/sam/cmd/nano-init`). Its datapath is the
[`tun2connect`](https://github.com/aojea/agents.net) library — gVisor's
netstack terminating the sandbox's TCP/IP in userspace, a `BoundaryClient`
speaking CONNECT and connect-udp, and a `VirtualDNS` preserving names — plus
`github.com/vishvananda/netlink` to build `tun0`. All of it lives in the
nano-init module, so the root `go.mod` is untouched and the host binaries
carry none of it.

Consuming the datapath as a library, rather than shipping a universal guest
binary, is a deliberate split: the engine, the tunnel client and the name
preservation are universal and live upstream with their own tests; what stays
in `nano-init` is exactly what is SAM- and platform-specific — the vsock
boundary for microVMs, `--create-namespaces` for pods, the `copy` mode for
image builds, and PID 1 duty.

Owning the guest datapath is what makes the rest of this design possible:

* the destination stays a **name** all the way to the tunnel request. A stack
  that proxies by address has already thrown away the thing policy reasons
  about, so the virtual DNS hands out synthetic addresses from
  `100.64.0.0/10` and `100::/64` and the engine restores the name when it
  opens the flow — and refuses a flow that never had one;
* policy and telemetry decisions can be made *inside* the guest — per-process
  attribution, for instance — which an external binary cannot be extended to do;
* it builds for whatever architectures the project builds for, with no
  third-party release URL pinned into the image;
* it is covered by `go test`, not only by the bats CUJ.

The module boundary is the point. A userspace network stack is a large
dependency, and keeping it in a separate module means it is a guest-image
concern rather than something every `sam-node` and `sam-box` build has to carry.

The host is unaffected either way: the sandbox boundary is CONNECT over a byte
stream, so the guest implementation could be replaced without changing anything
on the host or rewriting any test above.

## 8. Agent identity

### 8.1 Requirements

1. **Portable.** An agent paused on node A and resumed on node B is the same
   principal. Identity moves with the agent's state, never with the host.
2. **Verifiable mesh-wide.** Any peer can decide "agent `foo` may use
   `inference://X`, agent `bar` may not" without asking anyone.
3. **Scales to 10⁹ agents and services.** No central per-agent record, no
   per-agent mint on the hot path, no enumeration in any policy document, no
   revocation list proportional to the agent population.

### 8.2 The library constraint that decides the shape

`biscuit-go/v2 v2.2.0` has **no third-party blocks**: the library's own sample
suite explicitly skips `test024_third_party.bc`, and the API exposes no
public-key (`trusting`) checks. So an agent-signed block cannot be embedded
inside the node's token.

What the library *does* give us is exactly enough:

* `New` — mint under a root key;
* `CreateBlock` + `Append` — **offline attenuation**, no root key, no network;
* multi-root verification (`VerifyBiscuit(..., trustedPublicKeys, ...)`);
* `RevocationIds()` — per-block revocation identifiers;
* `Seal` — stop further attenuation.

Hence the agent's facts travel as an ordinary appended block on the node token
(Decision 5). This is not a workaround — it is why **`Authorize` needs no change
at all**: appended blocks are already part of the token and already evaluated,
so only the component that admits the agent has to learn to append. If
`biscuit-go` later gains third-party blocks, the agent can sign its own block
and non-repudiation arrives without a wire break.

### 8.2.1 What the agent claim covers, and what it does not

**Covers.** Attribution and policy on **both** datapaths. A peer can authorize
and audit "agent `reviewer-7` called me" rather than only "some node did", using
the existing vocabulary, because the claim is injected as an ordinary `agent()`
fact. `TestAgentPolicyCUJ` shows two agents behind two gateways on one node
being told apart by the provider's policy — over HTTP for inference and over the
libp2p stream for tool calls — including a lookalike authority being refused and
an unidentified sandbox being refused.

The two paths carry it differently because they authenticate differently: HTTP
requests carry `X-Sam-Agent`, and streams carry `AuthFrame.agent`. On the stream
path the claim is bound to the MCP *session* rather than the request, since the
SDK hands a tool handler the session's context and not the request's. That fits
how sandboxes work anyway: one gateway serves one agent, so a session belongs to
one agent for its whole life.

**Does not cover.**

* **Proof.** The claim is the calling node's word. A node that lies can name any
  agent, so a mesh that cares must also constrain which peers may speak for
  which agent namespaces. Carrying it in a header rather than a block costs
  nothing here: an appended block is exactly as forgeable by the same party.
* **Anything that never leaves the node**, which the boundary already gates
  locally.

**A consequence to design around.** A node's own housekeeping carries no agent,
because no agent asked for it. A provider whose policy demands an agent
unconditionally therefore also refuses that node's model-catalog probe, and its
models stop appearing in peers' `/v1/models` listings even though agents can
still call them. This was found by the test, not by reasoning. Policy that means
to gate agent traffic should say so rather than demanding an agent everywhere.

### 8.3 Why it scales: delegation, not enumeration

Three rules, each of which removes a per-agent bottleneck:

**Minting is offline and local.** The control plane never mints per agent. It
grants a *namespace holder* — in practice the enrolled `sam-node`/`sam-box` in a
cluster, scoped by its attestation (§8.6) — authority over an agent namespace,
once. That holder asserts a per-agent identity by appending a block to its own
token with `Append`: no root key, no round trip, no central state. Admitting an
agent is O(1) local work, which is the only way 10⁹ of them exist.

**Policy is written over namespaces, not identities.** This needs almost no new
machinery, because the existing vocabulary is already shaped for it:
`BuildTargetDatalogFacts` compiles targets into `granted_target_prefix`,
`granted_target_suffix`, `granted_target_set` and `granted_target_exact`. Making
`agent` a first-class principal is:

* `FactAgent = "agent"` in `api/datalog.go`;
* the agent block's `agent(...)` fact injected as a `target_fact` at
  authorization time.

After that, `allowed_targets: ["agent:acme/prod/*"]` works with **zero new
evaluation logic**, and "foo yes, bar no" is expressed as a namespace, a set or
a prefix — never as a list of a billion names.

**Revocation is tiered.** A revocation list sized like the agent population is
not a design, so nothing depends on one:

| what happened | mechanism | cost |
|---|---|---|
| agent is done or misbehaving | kill the sandbox | instant, local, free |
| credential must stop being usable elsewhere | short-lived workload credential; the platform stops renewing it | bounded window, no list |
| a namespace holder is compromised | `RevocationIds()` on its delegation block | one entry kills every agent under it |

### 8.4 How the identity travels

The agent's credential bundle lives **in the agent's own state**, next to
whatever else the platform migrates — not in `sam-box`'s configuration and not in
the node's store. Pause, snapshot, move, resume: `sam-box` on node B reads the
bundle from the migrated state and starts asserting it. **No control-plane call
on resume.** That is what makes migration cheap, and it is the same property
that makes 10⁹ agents possible.

### 8.5 Where the agent's identity comes from

Not from the agent. The harness stays unmodified (Goal 1), so it never asserts
anything about itself — it could only lie. It comes from the credential the
platform **already** issues to the workload:

* a **Kubernetes projected service-account token**, audience-scoped and
  short-lived;
* a **pod certificate** (KEP-4317) — which Substrate already provides today via
  its `podcertcontroller` polyfill;
* a **SPIFFE SVID**, where SPIRE is in play.

`sam-box` verifies that credential against the platform's issuer at admission —
in-cluster, cheap, no mesh round trip — and translates it into `agent:` facts by
the rules in §8.8. **The scheduler needs no mesh enrollment and no mesh
credential of its own.** It keeps doing exactly what it already does for every
workload: project an identity document. This is the OIDC relationship, not a
merger of the two domains.
The check that carries the weight is not the signature but the subject: the
credential must attest the `external_id` the bundle declares. Every sandbox on a
platform holds a valid credential, so verifying the signature alone would let
any of them claim to be any other. And the issuer is operator configuration
(`--credential-issuer`), never a bundle field — the bundle travels with the
agent, so an issuer named there could be one an attacker controls, and their
self-signed credential would verify perfectly.

Verification is the default: a bundle without an issuer to check it against is
refused. Deployments with no platform issuer can still run, but by saying so
(`--insecure-unverified-bundle`), because a name the whole mesh authorizes
against should not become trustworthy through a field being left unset.
`sam-box` then binds that identity to the channel, so nothing has to be asserted
in-band afterwards:

1. **One socket per agent (default).** Identity is a property of the socket,
   fixed when the sandbox is created: one vsock UDS per microVM, one bind-mounted
   socket per container. Nothing in-band, nothing to spoof.
2. **Proxy-Authorization (multiplexing).** When one `sam-box` fronts many agents
   over one socket, Basic credentials on the tunnel request carry the agent id
   and its admission token. It is standard, in-band, supported by every HTTP
   proxy client, and it makes identity **per-connection** — which is exactly
   what a multiplexer needs.

### 8.6 The honest limit

An enrolled node asserts its own agents, so a compromised node can claim any
agent identity inside the namespaces its role allows (`allowed_agents`, §3).
That limit is the mitigation, and the same policy machinery enforces it. Without
it, one compromised node could impersonate any agent anywhere. A node that holds
no grant cannot name any agent.

The grant is keyed on the node's **role**, not on its labels. Nodes declare
their own labels at OIDC enrollment and the control plane only checks the
syntax, so a namespace derived from a label would be one the node picked for
itself. Roles are resolved from verified OIDC claims against bindings the admin
wrote, so that chain holds all the way back.

Two things follow:

* How tight the limit is depends on the connector's naming (§8.8, property 5).
  If a name has no label for the boundary it runs in, the only grant you can
  write is a tenant-wide one.
* `allowed_agents: ["*"]` goes back to the old, unlimited behaviour. It is
  allowed because some meshes have a single tenant, and nodes log a warning so
  it is never silent.

Removing the residue entirely requires proof of possession: the agent holds a
key and signs a per-request binding. That needs either a mesh-aware harness
(violates Goal 1) or a signer inside the sandbox, and it needs third-party
blocks in `biscuit-go` to be attributable. It is a clean upgrade, not a rewrite.

### 8.7 Consequences for the plan

* `api/` — `FactAgent`, the §8.8 translation helpers, and
  the §10 bundle schema.
* `internal/node` — **nothing** for authorization: appended blocks are already
  verified and evaluated. Only the namespace-binding policy is new.
* `internal/sambox` — holds the bundle, attaches it per flow, per socket or per
  tunnel connection; serves the §10 control socket and routes the §9 serving
  channel.
* `cmd/nano-init` — owns the guest side of the ingress channel (§9.2).
* Sidecar — propagates the agent header on egress alongside `X-Sam-Biscuit`.
* Tests — the CUJ that demonstrates the selling point belongs at integration
  level: two agents behind one `sam-box`, same node, same mesh; `foo` reaches
  `inference://X` and `bar` is refused, purely on their own credentials.

### 8.8 The agent identifier

**Decided: dot-separated, DNS-shaped, most-specific-first.**
`agent:reviewer-7.prod.acme.example`, matched by `agent:*.prod.acme.example`.

The policy engine chooses this for us. `BuildTargetDatalogFact` compiles
`*.acme.example` into a suffix fact that **keeps the leading dot**
(`.acme.example`) and `acme.*` into a prefix fact that **keeps the trailing dot**
(`acme.`). Wildcards are therefore already anchored on dot boundaries:
`evil-acme.example` cannot match `*.acme.example`. A slash-separated
`agent:acme/prod/name` would need new fact types and new matching code, and
would reintroduce the boundary bug the dot anchoring already avoids. It also
matches every other name in the system: service names are validated by
`dnsNameRegex`, and mesh hosts are DNS-shaped (§Decision 4).

**Is it a mesh-only convention? Yes — and that is fine, for exactly the reason
you gave.** It is the same relationship the mesh already has with OIDC:
`translateClaimsToFacts` turns `sub`, `email` and `groups` into `user`, `email`
and `group` facts, and policy is written against *those*, never against the raw
JWT. Third parties do not adopt `agent:`; connectors translate into it.

A connector's translation must satisfy four properties, and this is the part
worth writing down because "without losing capabilities" lives here:

1. **Total** — every foreign identity maps to exactly one mesh identifier.
2. **Injective** — two foreign identities never collide, or policy leaks across
   tenants. The rightmost labels must be an authority the platform actually
   controls.
3. **Hierarchy-preserving** — foreign hierarchy boundaries must land on dot
   boundaries. This is the capability-preserving requirement: if the connector
   flattens the hierarchy, wildcard policies stop being expressible and the
   operator is forced back to enumeration.
4. **Auditable** — the original identifier travels verbatim alongside the
   translated one. Where translation cannot round-trip, the verbatim value is
   what an auditor reads.
5. **Bounded** — the name must include a label for the boundary where the
   agent's workload credential stops being valid, usually the cluster or trust
   domain. Node grants (`allowed_agents`, §8.6) are written against that label.
   A mapping can satisfy properties 1–4 and still fail this one: a flat
   `spiffe://acme.example/prod/reviewer-7` → `reviewer-7.prod.acme.example` has
   no cluster label, so every node hosting these agents needs a tenant-wide
   grant and the limit gets much weaker. The Kubernetes and Substrate rows
   below keep the cluster in the name, so their grants stay tight.

| foreign identity | mesh identifier |
|---|---|
| `spiffe://acme.example/prod/reviewer-7` | `agent:reviewer-7.prod.acme.example` |
| K8s SA `prod/reviewer` in cluster `c1.acme.example` | `agent:reviewer.prod.c1.acme.example` |
| OIDC `iss=https://acme.example`, `sub=reviewer-7` | `agent:reviewer-7.acme.example` |

Each segment must be a valid DNS label; a connector encodes anything else.
Non-hierarchical attributes do **not** belong in the name — that is what the
attested label machinery (`api/labels.go`) is for.

## 9. Ingress: agents that serve

An agent serves exactly one thing: itself, over A2A. `code-reviewer.a2a.sam.alt`
is already the name (Decision 4); serving it just means being its provider.
MCP and inference services are operator services, declared in a node's
configuration — an agent is not a generic backend and never advertises one.

### 9.1 Declaring: a static contract, no runtime registration

The agent does **not** declare anything, to anyone, ever. There is no
registration API on the node — services only exist by declaration in the
node's configuration at startup — and there is no announce endpoint on the
gateway. Both facts follow from the same rule: anything an agent can request
at runtime is an interface it can abuse. A runtime declaration carries a
*name*, so an agent could advertise itself as `code-reviewer` under the
node's identity and take over somebody else's traffic; give it a
`target_url` and it can point the mesh at anything and turn its node into an
open relay.

So the whole route is contracted before the agent runs:

* **The bundle names what the agent serves** (§10.1 `serves`): one name, one
  port. `sam-box` routes that name to that port inside the sandbox from
  startup, over the reverse channel (§9.2). A name outside the contract is
  not expressible rather than merely rejected.
* **The node's configuration declares the service** — `type: a2a`, the
  contracted name, `target_url` pointing at the gateway's serving listener.
* **Advertisement is gated on the probe.** The node fetches the agent's card
  (`/.well-known/agent-card.json`) through the gateway before advertising,
  and keeps re-probing. An agent that is not up yet, or has died, is simply
  not discoverable; when it answers, it is. Readiness is observed, never
  asserted.

The agent runs a stock A2A server on its contracted port and knows nothing
else. Its card can claim any address it likes — the mesh regenerates the
card at the consumer edge (interfaces rewritten to the mesh path, stale
signatures dropped), so nothing the agent writes in its own card escapes the
sandbox unverified.

**Implemented, including delivery into an isolated sandbox.** Reaching back in
cannot be done by dialling the agent: every sandbox has a network namespace of
its own, so the gateway's `127.0.0.1` is its own loopback and not the agent's.
That is true of all three profiles, because it follows from the isolation
rather than from any one runtime.

The way in is the way out. Egress crosses the boundary over a pathname Unix
socket, which network namespaces do not apply to because it is a filesystem
object. Ingress uses a second one: `nano-init --ingress-socket` serves it from
inside the sandbox, where it can reach the agent at the contracted port, and
`sam-box --agent-ingress-socket` dials it. The handshake is Firecracker's —
`CONNECT <port>`, then `OK` — so a microVM can offer the same protocol over
vsock without the gateway learning the difference.

`TestSandboxServesThroughTheReverseChannel` drives a real sandbox and asserts
both halves: that dialling the agent directly from outside fails, and that the
same agent answers through the channel. `TestAgentIngressCUJ` covers the
mesh-facing half with a stock A2A SDK on both ends: the card is regenerated at
the consumer, the message round-trips, and the agent has no serving surface to
ask anything of.

### 9.1.1 Why this is also the better UX

The runtime-announcement design this replaces argued that only the agent
knows *when* it is ready and *which port* it chose. Both turned out to be
better served without an API:

* **Readiness is the probe's job.** A declared-but-dead service is registered
  yet withheld from discovery until its card answers. That closes the
  advertise-before-listening window without a health-check protocol — and
  without trusting the agent's claim, which the old design listed as an open
  problem.
* **The port is part of the contract.** An agent that must be told nothing
  can still be told one thing by its environment (every serverless platform
  does exactly this); in exchange, port flapping and re-registration rate
  limits stop being problems because re-registration does not exist.
* **Lifetime is tied to the sandbox, structurally.** The gateway's serving
  listener closes when the sandbox goes; the probe fails; discovery
  converges. Nothing unregisters because nothing registered.
* **Resume is still automatic.** The bundle travels with the agent (§8.4), so
  `Attach` on another host renders the same contract: the new gateway routes
  the same name, the new node declares the same service, and the probe
  re-points discovery to the new peer. The property §8 exists to provide
  survives — it never needed a runtime API, only a declaration that moves
  with the agent.

### 9.2 The reverse channel

Inbound is the one place the datapath is not egress-shaped:

```text
remote peer → libp2p → sam-node → sam-box ingress endpoint
                                        │
                                        ▼  one stream per inbound request
                                   sandbox boundary
                                        │
                                   nano-init accept loop
                                        │
                                   127.0.0.1:<port>  (the agent's listener)
```

So a sandbox has exactly two channels, one per direction:

| channel | direction | protocol | who listens |
|---|---|---|---|
| egress | guest → host | named HTTP tunnels (CONNECT, connect-udp) | host (`sam-box`) |
| ingress | host → guest | one stream per request (`CONNECT <port>`) | guest (`nano-init`) |

Firecracker's vsock is bidirectional, so host→guest needs no new transport: the
host connects to the firecracker UDS and writes `CONNECT <port>`, with the guest
listening on that vsock port. A container gets the symmetric arrangement with a
second bind-mounted socket. This is also what finally justifies `nano-init`
beyond PID 1 hygiene: it owns the guest side of the ingress channel.

### 9.3 Authorization closes the loop

Nothing new is needed. `sam-node` authorizes the **caller** — their node token
carrying their agent block (Decision 5) — before the stream ever reaches
`sam-box`. "Agent `foo` may call agent `bar`" is therefore one policy statement,
evaluated at `bar`'s node, with the existing machinery, and both ends are named
by portable identities rather than by hosts.

### 9.4 Migration

The serving contract is part of what travels (§8.4). On resume, `sam-box` on
node B routes the same contracted name, node B's configuration declares the
same service, and the probe re-points discovery to node B. The name is
stable because it belongs to the agent, not to the node — which is the whole
point of §8.

## 10. The platform integration interface

This is the seam a scheduler or harness connector builds against. It must be
small, versioned, and the only place identity enters the system.

### 10.1 The agent bundle

What the platform provides per agent. It lives in the agent's state directory, so
it migrates with the agent by construction:

```yaml
version: v1
agent:
  id: reviewer-7.prod.acme.example          # canonical mesh identifier (§8.8)
  external_id: spiffe://acme.example/prod/reviewer-7   # verbatim, for audit
  credential: /var/run/secrets/substrate/token  # the platform's own workload
                                                # credential, verified at
                                                # admission (§8.5)
egress:
  allow: ["api.github.com", "*.pypi.org"]
  secrets:
    "api.github.com": {kind: bearer, value_from: /etc/sam/secrets/github}
serves:
  name: code-reviewer   # the agent's A2A name; routed to its contracted port
  port: 8080
```

### 10.2 Operations

Exposed by `sam-box` on a control socket that is **not** reachable from inside
the sandbox:

| operation | meaning |
|---|---|
| `Attach(bundle)` | admit an agent; returns the egress and ingress endpoints to wire into the sandbox |
| `Detach(agent_id)` | stop it: close the serving listener and channels, drop credentials |
| `Refresh(agent_id, credential)` | hand in a rotated workload credential (§8.3) |
| `Status(agent_id)` | what is routed and connected, for the scheduler's reconcile loop |

### 10.3 Guarantees the interface owes a connector

1. **`Attach` is idempotent, keyed by agent id.** Resume after a crash or a
   migration is just another `Attach` — no special-case path.
2. **Identity never arrives in-band from the sandbox.** The platform is the sole
   identity source (§8.5).
3. **The agent id is stable across `Attach` on different hosts.** This is what
   makes migration invisible to the rest of the mesh.
4. **`Detach` is complete.** No residual advertisement; discovery converges.
5. **Versioned.** `version: v1`, and the schema lives in `api/`, so it is a real
   contract and not a convention.

### 10.4 The first connector: Agent Substrate

[Agent Substrate](https://github.com/agent-substrate/substrate) is the
integration target, and it lines up unusually well:

| Substrate | SAM |
|---|---|
| **Actor** (the agent) | the principal: `agent:<actor>.<atespace>.<cluster domain>` |
| **Atespace** (namespace) | the hierarchy label policy wildcards on |
| routing by Host `my-counter-1.demo.actors.resources.substrate.ate.dev` | already dot-separated and most-specific-first — the same shape as §8.8 |
| `podcertcontroller` (KEP-4317 pod certificates), projected SA tokens | the workload credential `sam-box` verifies at admission (§8.5) |
| `atelet` per-node DaemonSet; `ateom-gvisor` / `ateom-microvm` | where `sam-box` attaches: one sandbox, two channels |
| suspend/resume with full-state snapshot (RAM + filesystem) | carries the agent bundle with no extra work (§8.4) |
| `atenet` (DNS, Envoy routing, proxy sidecars, CONNECT) | the seam to negotiate: who owns egress |

The name mapping is a pure string translation with no capability loss, which is
the §8.8 test: the Host `my-counter-1.demo.actors.resources.substrate.ate.dev`
becomes `agent:my-counter-1.demo.actors.resources.substrate.ate.dev`, and
`agent:*.demo.actors.resources.substrate.ate.dev` means "every actor in atespace
`demo`" — injective, hierarchy-preserving, reversible.

Two things to settle **with** the Substrate side rather than assume:

* **Egress ownership.** `atenet` already supplies DNS, routing, proxy sidecars
  and CONNECT. The named-tunnel boundary has to slot in as the sandbox's egress
  rather than compete with it — speaking CONNECT is what makes that a fit
  rather than a translation. `sam-box` behind atenet's sidecar seam is the
  likely arrangement, but that is a conversation, not a decision to take
  unilaterally.
* **Ingress.** Substrate already routes inbound to actors by Host header. §9
  must reuse that path rather than build a parallel one: a SAM ingress
  declaration should end up as a Substrate route.

### 10.5 Still to settle

* **Wire format — decided.** Proto in `api/sam.proto` for the operations
  (`AgentAttach`/`AgentDetach`/`AgentRefresh`/`AgentStatus` request and response
  messages), YAML for the bundle. Substrate is Go, so proto costs its connector
  nothing; the bundle stays YAML because its canonical copy is a file in the
  agent's state directory, where it has to be readable and diffable by whoever
  operates the platform. `AgentBundle` in the proto is the transport mirror of
  that file, not a second source of truth.
* **Bulk pre-creation is deliberately not in v1** — premature until the semantics
  are proven. What v1 owes it is *room*: `Attach` takes a bundle and is
  idempotent per agent id, so `AttachBatch` is a purely additive operation
  later, and the offline attenuation in §8.3 already makes it possible with no
  protocol change.

## 11. Remaining smaller open items

1. **UDP — shipped.** Carried as connect-udp (RFC 9298) with capsules on the
   same one-socket boundary, under the same name-based deny-by-default policy.
   DNS never leaves the guest either way: port 53 is answered by the virtual
   DNS, and everything else is a named, policy-checked session.
2. **Guest trust of the ephemeral CA.** Baked into the sandbox image at build
   time, or re-introduce a bootstrap endpoint? v1 avoids the question by keeping
   mesh names on `http://` (§5.2).
3. **Peer-pinned mesh names.** Deferred until a DNS-safe peer encoding is chosen
   (Decision 4).
