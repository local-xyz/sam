The `sam-node` acts as a local security gateway and tool proxy for AI agents. While the control plane is the central authority, each Node independently defines its own local tool catalogue and enforces its own local security identity.

---

## 1. Node Configuration File (`sam-node.yaml`)

By default, `sam-node` runs without exposing any local tools to the mesh. To expose local tools or strictly enforce your node's network identity, you must create a Node configuration file and pass it to the daemon using the `--config` flag:

```bash
SAM_API_TOKEN="secret" sam-node run --config ./sam-node.yaml
```

### Configuration Schema

The `sam-node.yaml` file supports declaring the node's **Labels**, its local **Services**, and local **Attenuation** security rules.

```yaml
version: "v1alpha1"

# 1. Declare this node's operator labels (see section 4)
labels:
  region: us-east-1
  team: platform

# 2. Define Local Services
services:
  # Example: Expose a local CLI MCP server to the mesh (stdio subprocess)
  - type: mcp
    name: local-shell-tools
    description: "Execute bash commands safely in a local container"
    command: ["npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything"]

  # Example: Expose an existing HTTP MCP server to the mesh (no subprocess)
  - type: mcp
    name: remote-docs-server
    description: "Proxy an already-running Streamable HTTP MCP server"
    target_url: "http://localhost:9001/mcp"

  # Example: Expose a local inference endpoint
  - type: inference
    name: local-ollama
    description: "DeepSeek local inference proxy"
    target_url: "http://localhost:11434"

# 3. Define Local Security Identity (Zero Trust)
attenuation:
  rules:
    # Example: Inject custom Datalog facts asserting local node state
    - 'time(2026-06-30T00:00:00Z) <- true;'
  policies:
    # Example: Custom local deny rule restricting access from untrusted users
    - 'deny if user("untrusted_sub_id");'
```

## 2. Defining Local Services

The `services` array allows you to register endpoints that remote peers in the SAM Network can discover and execute (provided they possess the proper `granted_service_*` credentials issued by the control plane).

| Property | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `type` | The service type: `mcp` (Model Context Protocol), `inference`, `a2a`, or `http` (opaque HTTP). |
| `name` | The unique name of the service (e.g., `git-helper`). This must exactly match the name authorized by the control plane's mesh policy (e.g., `mcp://git-helper`). |
| `description` | A human-readable description published to the mesh discovery catalogue. |
| `command` | *(For MCP)* The executable command array to spawn as a local subprocess, speaking MCP over stdio (e.g. `["node", "index.js"]`). Mutually exclusive with `target_url`. |
| `env` | *(For MCP)* Key-value environment variables passed to the subprocess. |
| `target_url` | *(For MCP/Inference/A2A/HTTP)* The upstream URL to proxy traffic to. For `type: mcp`, this points to an already-running Streamable HTTP MCP server; SAM does not spawn or manage its lifecycle, but only proxies to it. Mutually exclusive with `command`. Must not carry a credential (`http://user:pass@...` is refused); use `target_auth_path`. |
| `target_auth_path` | *(Optional, with `target_url`)* Path to a file holding the credential the backend requires: a bare `TOKEN` is sent as `Authorization: Bearer TOKEN`, `user:pass` as HTTP Basic. The node reads the file once at start, presents the credential on every request to the backend (overriding any `Authorization` a caller sent) and never advertises or logs it. A file, not a value, because `sam-node.yaml` is copied, committed and rendered into ConfigMaps; mount a Secret and point here, as with `--api-token-path`. |

### Inference Service Path Standards & Proxy Routing

When configuring `target_url` for `type: inference` services (e.g. Ollama, vLLM, OpenAI-compatible backends):
* **Root Target URL Standard**: Always register `target_url` using the base root URL (e.g. `http://localhost:11434` or `http://localhost:8000`), strictly omitting `/v1`.
* **OpenAI Facade Access**: Clients connecting via the node's local OpenAI Facade (`http://localhost:8080/v1`) request paths like `/v1/chat/completions`. SAM automatically proxies these to the backend's root URL.
* **Raw Proxy Access**: If bypassing the Facade and making requests directly via the local egress proxy (`/sam/{peer}/inference/{service}`), the request path must include the explicit `/v1` namespace suffix (e.g. `http://localhost:8080/sam/{peer}/inference/{service}/v1/chat/completions`).

### HTTP Service Routing

Use `type: http` for an existing HTTP application that owns its own protocol:

```yaml
services:
  - type: http
    name: roomlink
    target_url: http://127.0.0.1:8642
```

Peers discover it with `/sam/service/discover?type=http&name=roomlink` and call
`/sam/{peer}/http/roomlink/...` through their local node. Control-plane service
grants use `http://roomlink`. All participating nodes need HTTP service support.

The existing mesh proxy carries methods, paths, queries, request bodies, response
statuses, and streaming HTTP responses (including SSE). SAM applies its normal
peer authentication and local attenuation; it does not interpret events or add
application retries, persistence, or an A2A agent card. Only URL backends are
supported. No protocol-specific health probe runs: discovery announces the
configured service, not proof that its backend is ready.

Authenticate to the local sidecar using `X-Sam-Authentication: Bearer <token>`.
SAM strips that header before forwarding and preserves the application's
`Authorization` header. Leave `target_auth_path` unset when the backend needs
caller-specific credentials such as a Hermes room grant; configuring it overrides
the caller's `Authorization` on every request.

### A2A Service Routing

When configuring `type: a2a` services (Agent2Agent protocol agents):
* **URL backends only**: register the agent's local HTTP endpoint as `target_url`. `command` backends are rejected.
* **Raw Proxy Access**: remote peers reach the agent at `http://localhost:8080/sam/{peer}/a2a/{service}/...`. For the agent card at `.../.well-known/agent-card.json`, the caller's node impersonates the endpoint: it fetches the card from the agent (A2A v1.0 format) and serves a regenerated one whose interface URLs point back at this mesh path; protocol bindings the mesh cannot carry (gRPC) are dropped, streaming is advertised off, and the original signatures are removed since the content changed.
* **Label-gated egress**: setting `X-Sam-Required-Labels: key=value[,key=value]` on a raw a2a request makes the caller's node verify the provider's control-plane-attested labels and refuse fail-closed (HTTP 403) before any data leaves the node. The header is stripped before forwarding.
* **Runnable example**: the [A2A Chat use case](../../use-cases/chat-a2a/) walks through hosting an a2a agent on a kind mesh and talking to it with a stock `a2a-sdk` client.

## 3. Defining Local Security (Target Attenuation)

In a Zero Trust architecture, the destination node is entirely responsible for verifying that it is the intended recipient of an incoming request.

While the control plane limits token capabilities based on target restrictions (e.g., `target_restricted()` or `target_unrestricted()`), the destination node evaluates these dynamically. The node automatically resolves its local identity context based on its configuration, generating facts internally (such as `allow_network_target($fact, $value)`).

If the caller's token has target restrictions, the connection will only be allowed if the token's `granted_target_*` facts match the dynamically injected identity of the node. You do **not** need to write manual Datalog rules to enforce this mechanism; it is baked directly into the node middleware via baseline policies.

### Local Custom Policies
You can further restrict access using the `attenuation` block. Local policies defined here are evaluated **before** the baseline rules. This means local administrators can write custom rules that explicitly `deny` access based on custom logic, overriding broad access granted by the control plane.

1. **`rules`**: Inject custom Datalog facts asserting local node state (e.g., `time($time)`).
2. **`policies`**: Add local restrictions (e.g., `deny if user("banned_user");`).
3. **`checks`**: Require a condition for any connection to succeed (e.g., `check if label("region", "eu-west-1");`).

---

## 4. Labels & Data Sovereignty

SAM supports attested key=value labels (e.g. `region`, `team`) so a request never leaves a required scope. Cloud providers, on-prem operators, and countries all name regions differently, so SAM imposes no built-in taxonomy or hierarchy: composition (e.g. also attesting a coarser value) is entirely up to the operator.

### Declaring labels (provider)

Declare the node's operator labels in its configuration file:

```yaml
version: "v1alpha1"
labels:
  region: us-east-1
  team: platform
```

Both `sam-node join` and `sam-node run` read this file (`--config` is a global flag), so the labels are declared on whichever of them enrols the node. Keys are 1-63 characters of `[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]`; a value must be non-empty, at most 255 characters, and free of `,`, `=` and control characters, since the wire format is a comma-separated `key=value` list. A malformed entry stops the node at startup.

Labels are declared at enrollment and **attested by the control plane**, but only the ones a role permits. Set `allowed_labels` on the node's role (see [control plane configuration](../control-plane-configuration/)); a role granting none means the node can declare none, and enrollment is refused if it tries. This applies to all three enrollment paths, including bootstrap requests an administrator approves by hand: approving says the identity may join, so the role grant is what says which labels it may carry. The control plane then mints one signed `label(key, value)` fact per declared label into the node's Biscuit. Matching is exact and case-sensitive; an empty value means no claim for that key.

### Requiring labels (consumer)

On the sidecar's OpenAI-compatible endpoints, constrain a request with the `X-Sam-Required-Labels` header (comma-separated `key=value` pairs, any-of):

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SAM_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Sam-Required-Labels: region=us-east-1" \
  -d '{"model":"test-model","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}]}'
```

The `call_remote_tool` MCP tool accepts the same requirement via its `required_labels` parameter.

Enforcement is fail-closed and cryptographic: gossiped labels only rank candidate providers, and before any request data leaves your node the sidecar verifies the provider's control-plane-signed Biscuit and checks its attested `label()` facts. Providers that return no identity or lack a matching fact are rejected.

### Requiring labels of every provider (operator floor)

The header above is the caller's requirement, and a caller that sends no header is unconstrained. To hold a boundary the caller cannot waive, set a floor in the node config:

```yaml
egress:
  require_labels:      # every pair must hold, and callers cannot widen it
    jurisdiction: eu
    compliance: gdpr
```

Every remote provider must then attest all of these before the node sends it anything, whether or not the caller asked for labels. A caller may still narrow the choice further with `X-Sam-Required-Labels`; the two are checked independently, so a caller naming an unrelated label cannot stand in for the floor.

Note the difference in meaning between the two, which follows from what each is for:

| | Semantics |
|---|---|
| `X-Sam-Required-Labels` (caller) | **any** pair is enough — the caller is choosing among acceptable providers |
| `egress.require_labels` (operator) | **every** pair must hold — the operator is drawing a boundary |

A floor naming a label no provider attests reaches nothing, which makes it a usable egress kill switch. Omit the block entirely to keep the previous behaviour, where the requirement is whatever the caller supplied.

### Restricting callers by label (provider)

Because every enrolled node's token carries its attested label facts, a provider can require callers to hold a label with a single local check in its `attenuation` block:

```yaml
attenuation:
  checks:
    - 'check if label("region", "us-east-1");'
    - 'check if label("jurisdiction", "eu");'
```
